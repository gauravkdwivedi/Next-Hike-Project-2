# Next-Hike-Project-2 - Data Acquisition, Data Wrangling, Checking Skewness and correlation of the data

## Overview

This project is comprehensive data wrangling effort to prepare raw data for analysis and modelling. It includes data acquisition, preprocessing, and the indentification skewness and correlation of the data. Proper data preparation is a cretical step in ensuring tha the data is clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

## Data Wrangling Techiques used in this project

- **Merge Datasets**: Combining data from multiple sources to create a unified dataset.
- **Concatenate Datasets**: Stacking or joining datasets to create a single, consolidated dataset.
- **Identify Unique Values**: Profiling the data to understand distinct categories or elements.
- **Drop Unnecessary Columns**: Removing irrelevant or redundant data columns.
- **Check Dataset Dimension**: Verifying the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- **Check Datatype**: Ensuring that data types match expectations and identifying inconsistencies.
- **Check Datatype Summary**: Summarizing data types and the count of non-null values.
- **Treat Missing Values**: Handling missing data using appropriate methods such as imputation or removal.

- ## Usage

This project provides a systematic approach to data wrangling and serves as a foundation for subsequent data analysis and modeling tasks. It can be adapted and extended for various data preprocessing needs.
